# TadkaProject

This is a project in progress. I'm hoping to create an app that stores a repository of all your recipes in a minimal UI. 
-Profiles of different users feature their repository of recipes.
-"Add this recipe to my pantry" button to each recipe allows a recipe to be added to users' repository.
-"What should I eat for dinner today" button parses through your recipe repository and picks a random recipe.
  -Optional: Filter recipes by ingredients available or tags.
